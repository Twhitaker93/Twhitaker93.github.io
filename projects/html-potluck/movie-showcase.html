        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        
        <p>
            In 15th-century Transylvania, Vlad III (Luke Evans), prince of 
            Wallachia, is known as a just ruler. With his beloved wife, Mirena 
            (Sarah Gadon), Vlad has brokered a prolonged period of peace and 
            ensured that his people are protected, especially from the Ottoman 
            Empire. However, when Sultan Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) demands 
            1,000 of the country's boys, including Vlad's son, for his army, 
            Vlad makes a deal with a monster that will enable him to defeat the 
            Turks -- but cost him his humanity.
