                    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                    Teen Wolf revolves around Scott McCall, a high school student 
                    living in the fictional California town of Beacon Hills. Scott 
                    becomes the eponymous teenage werewolf of the series after he is 
                    bitten by an alpha werewolf the night before his second year of 
                    high school, drastically changing his once-ordinary life. The 
                    bite forces him to balance his new identity with day-to-day 
                    teenage life and eventually help protect his hometown, which he 
                    learns is a beacon for supernatural activity.

                    Scott begins the series as a relatively unpopular and unathletic 
                    student who lives with his divorced mother Melissa, a nurse at 
                    Beacon Hills Memorial Hospital. As a werewolf, he develops 
                    heightened physical abilities and senses well beyond those of an 
                    ordinary human, but he also must control animalistic instincts 
                    that are amplified by feelings of aggression and full moons. 
                    Further complicating matters, Scott develops romantic feelings 
                    for new classmate Allison Argent, who comes from a family of 
                    werewolf hunters that includes her father Chris Argent. Helping 
                    Scott manage his new life are his best friend Stiles Stilinski, 
                    the son of Beacon Hills Sheriff Stilinski, and the natural-born 
                    werewolf Derek Hale

                <p>
                    Tyler Posey as Scott McCall: Scott is turned into a werewolf 
                    in the series premiere. Together with his friend Stiles, 
                    they begin to uncover the complicated supernatural world of 
                    Beacon Hills, California. Crystal Reed (seasons 1–3; guest 
                    season 5) as Allison Argent: Scott's first love interest, 
                    Allison descends from a long line of werewolf hunters. Her 
                    formidable prowess with a bow and arrow is an asset to the team 
                    in encounters with the shapeshifters and monsters that roam 
                    Beacon Hills. Reed also portrays Allison's ancestor Marie-Jeanne 
                    Valet in the fifth season. Dylan O'Brien as Stiles Stilinski: 
                    Stiles is Scott's childhood best friend, with a talent for 
                    solving mysteries and a fierce loyalty to those closest to him. 
                    As a young child, Stiles is portrayed by Anthony Lapenna. 
                    O'Brien also portrays the Nogitsune, a demon who possesses 
                    Stiles.
                    Tyler Hoechlin (seasons 1–4; guest 
                    season 6) as Derek Hale: An older werewolf from a prominent 
                    werewolf family in Beacon Hills, Derek starts off with a hostile 
                    relationship towards Scott and his "pack" of friends, but comes 
                    to be a valuable ally. Ian Nelson portrays the teenage Derek.
                    Holland Roden as Lydia Martin: A popular 
                    girl at Beacon Hills High and a close friend of Allison's. Lydia 
                    initially tries to play down her formidable intelligence, but 
                    she is a genius. After an encounter with Derek's villainous 
                    uncle Peter Hale in season one, her own supernatural abilities—
                    those of a banshee—begin to manifest.
                    Colton Haynes (seasons 1–2; guest season 
                    6) as Jackson Whittemore: Lydia's shallow boyfriend. Jackson 
                    antagonizes Scott and Stiles relentlessly but suffers from inner 
                    self-hatred. This causes his encounter with a werewolf's bite to 
                    turn him into another sort of creature: the deadly reptilian 
                    kanima. Jackson abruptly leaves Beacon Hills in the gap between 
                    seasons two and three, but returns for a guest stint at the end 
                    of season six, having come out and entered a relationship with 
                    another werewolf, Ethan.
