                    I was excited that there was aged Parmesan in this sauce, 
                    but once I tasted it, things went south quickly. Samantha 
                    called it “not good. Very sour and weird texture. My least 
                    favorite. Sticky and slimy.” Maddie found it “too salty. I 
                    couldn’t eat more—it felt dehydrating—but the texture was 
                    good.” I didn’t even sugarcoat my thoughts: “Sour. Foul. I 
                    hate it.” All three of us ranked it in our bottom picks, 
                    proving that even good cheese can’t save a bad base. $4.99 
                    for 15 ounces

                    This was the most expensive jar, and it showed in the flavor
                    . Samantha found it “very cheesy! Well flavored. Felt 
                    luxurious.” Maddie liked “the silky texture but ultimately 
                    thought it had too much garlic and butter. I thought it was 
                    “super cheesy, almost mac-and-cheese-like. Very beige in 
                    color.” It’s indulgent, but maybe not worth the splurge 
                    unless you really love garlic. $11.19 for 15 ounces

                    This was one of the richest and most satisfying sauces in 
                    our lineup. Samantha called it “very good! Very cheesy. 
                    Tangy and rich.” Maddie said it was “so good!…[creamy] taste 
                    and glossy texture.” I found it “so cheesy…very peppery.” It 
                    was almost perfect, but was just edged out by the last two 
                    because of its pretty high price point. If you’re in the 
                    mood to splurge, grab this one. $9.99 for 15 ounces

                    We all loved this sauce from our neighborhood TJ’s. It was 
                    creamy, nutty and well-balanced, which landed it in our top 
                    spot. Samantha said it was “very delicious and creamy…great 
                    blend of both cheese and cream flavors.” Maddie called it 
                    “really soft and garlicky…my favorite so far.” I said it was 
                    “creamy and mild, non-offensive, thicker than the others.” 
                    It’s affordable, flavorful and it’s the sauce we’d all 
                    happily buy again. $3.29 for 16.9 ounces
