                In a large cast-iron casserole, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil. 
                Add the carrot, onion and celery and cook over high heat,

                Preheat oven to 400°F. Stir together butter, truffle paste, 
                lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in small bowl until combined. 
                Set aside.

                Toss together mushrooms, 1 tablespoon oil, pepper, and remaining 
                1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl until coated. Spread in an 
                even layer on a small rimmed baking sheet. Roast in preheated 
                oven until tender and golden brown, about 15 minutes, stirring 
                halfway through cook time. Let cool to room temperature.

                cook garlic and remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a 12-inch skillet

                emulsified, about 1 minute, adding reserved cooking liquid 1 
                tablespoon at a time until desired sauce consistency is reached. 
                Remove from heat. Add parsley and 1 tablespoon cheese; toss to 
                combine. Divide pasta between 2 bowls; sprinkle with remaining 1

            <b>Making the filling</b>
        </h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Dice the prosciutto and transfer to a bowl. Freeze until very 
                firm, 30 minutes. In a food processor, pulse the chilled 
                prosciutto until finely chopped, about 30 seconds. Return to the 
                bowl.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Meanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, blanch the spinach 
                until just tender, about 1 minute. Transfer to a colander and 
                let cool slightly. Press out all of the excess water and 
                coarsely chop the spinach; you should have 1/2 cup.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                In a medium bowl, whisk the ricotta until smooth. Add the 
                prosciutto along with the chopped spinach, the mascarpone, egg 
                yolks and Parmesan; stir well. Season with salt. Cover the 
                filling with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 30 
                minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>
            <b>Making the pasta</b>
        </h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk the 00 flour with the salt; make a well 
                in the center. Add the egg yolks and 1 tablespoon of water to 
                the well and mix. Using a fork, gradually incorporate the flour 
                into the wet ingredients until a shaggy dough forms. Scrape the 
                dough out onto a work surface very lightly dusted with semolina 
                flour and knead until stiff but smooth, 5 minutes. Wrap in 
                plastic and let rest at room temperature until softened, 45 
                minutes.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Generously dust a work surface with semolina flour. Line a 
                rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and dust with semolina 
                flour. Divide the pasta dough into 4 pieces and work with one at 
                a time; keep the rest covered. Press the dough to flatten. Using 
                a hand-cranked pasta machine and starting at the widest setting, 
                run the dough twice through each of the first 5 settings, then 
                run it once through the sixth setting. Cut the sheet in half; 
                run each half through the thinnest setting one time. Transfer 
                the sheets to the prepared work surface.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Lay 1 pasta sheet on a work surface with a long edge facing you. 
                Spoon eight 1-teaspoon-size balls of filling in each of 2 rows 
                on the sheet, allowing 1 inch of space between them. Very 
                lightly brush the dough around the filling with water. Place the 
                second pasta sheet on top. Using your fingers, press the dough 
                around each mound of filling. Using a 2-inch fluted cutter, 
                stamp out the ravioli; transfer to the semolina-dusted baking 
                sheet. Cover with a clean tea towel. Repeat with the remaining 
                dough and filling to make 64 ravioli.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                In a pot of salted boiling water, cook the ravioli in 2 batches 
                until the edges are tender, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted 
                spoon, transfer to a shallow bowl. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking 
                water.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in each of 2 large skillets. 
                Add 1/2 cup of the pasta water and half of the chopped spinach 
                to each skillet and cook over moderately high heat until the 
                spinach is just wilted, about 1 minute. Add half of the ravioli 
                to each skillet and cook, stirring gently, until they are coated 
                in butter. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the ravioli and 
                spinach to a large serving bowl. Scrape the remaining liquid 
                from 1 large skillet into the other. Add the remaining 2 
                tablespoons of butter to the skillet along with 1 teaspoon of 
                the fennel pollen and 1/4 cup of the cheese. Cook over moderate 
                heat, swirling the pan gently, until the butter has melted and 
                the sauce has thickened slightly, about 1 minute. Scrape the 
                sauce over the ravioli. Sprinkle with the remaining fennel 
                pollen and cheese and serve immediately.
