            Think garlic bread, but way more fun. This hasselback grilled cheese 
            has more surface area for that garlicky butter to soak in and get 
            extra crispy, with melty cheese hiding in the middle. Rip off little 
            squares as you eat and enjoy a cheese pull with every bite.

        Sandwich Assembly

        <ul>
            <li>
                12 slices white sandwich bread (Japanese milk bread or thick 
                slices preferred)
            </li>
            <li>6 slices white American cheese</li>
            <li>6 slices white cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

            <b>Instructions</b>
        </h1>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by making the garlic butter. In a bowl, mix together the 
                melted butter, finely chopped parsley, minced garlic, grated 
                parmesan, black pepper, oregano, and salt until smooth and fully 
                combined. Set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Take your 12 slices of white sandwich bread. For each sandwich,
                you'll need one whole slice for the bottom and one crisscut ha-
                selback slice for the top.To hasselback the top slice, start by 
                making one vertical cut straight down the center just 2/3 to 3/4 
                of the way down. Then make one cut halfway between the center 
                and the left edge, and another cut halfway between the center 
                and the right edge—this gives you three evenly spaced vertical 
                cuts. Turn the bread 90 degrees and repeat the same process 
                horizontally. Make sure to slice only about 2/3 to 3/4 of the 
                way down so the bottom of the bread stays intact and you get 
                that perfect grid on top without the slice falling apart.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Grab a nonstick baking tray and lightly brush the surface with 
                some of the garlic butter. Place 6 of the whole bread slices 
                directly on the tray. On each slice, layer one slice of white 
                American cheese and one slice of white cheddar cheese. You can 
                stack them or slightly overlap.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Top each sandwich with one of the hasselbacked slices. Press it 
                down gently so it sits evenly on the cheese. Use a pastry brush 
                or spoon to generously coat the top and all sides of the bread 
                with garlic butter, making sure it gets into every cut and edge.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake at 375°F for 10 to 12 minutes, until the cheese is melted 
                and the tops are golden and crisp. For extra browning, broil 
                during the last 1 to 2 minutes—just keep a close eye so it 
                doesn't burn.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Let cool for a minute, then slice and serve warm.</li>
